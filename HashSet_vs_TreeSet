HashSet vs TreeSet

reference from : https://beginnersbook.com/2014/08/difference-between-hashset-and-treeset/

1. Difference:
   1) HashSet gives better performance (faster) than TreeSet for the operations
      like add, remove, contains, size etc. HashSet offers constant time cost while
      TreeSet offers log(n) time cost for such operations.

   2) HashSet does not maintain any order of elements while TreeSet elements
      are sorted in ascending order by default.


2. Similarities:
   1) Both HashSet and TreeSet does not hold duplicate elements,
      which means both of these are duplicate free.

   2) If you want a sorted Set then it is better to add elements to HashSet
      and then convert it into TreeSet rather than creating a TreeSet and adding elements to it.

   3) Both of these classes are non-synchronized that means they are
      not thread-safe and should be synchronized explicitly when there is a need of thread-safe operations.
